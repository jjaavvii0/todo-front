# Features:
- New rows can be added by clicking the "Add new row" button. This action will open a modal where you need to fill out the fields and then click "OK" to submit.

- If there are more than 10 rows, a new page will be created, and you can navigate between pages using the buttons located at the bottom right.

- The status can be changed by clicking on the "DONE" or "PENDING" label. To modify the "Name" or "Description," you need to double-click on the cell you want to edit. Any changes you make will be lost unless you send them to the server using the first button in the "Actions" column. This button becomes enabled when there are unsaved changes.

- You can also delete rows by using the delete button (the second one) in the "Actions" column.
